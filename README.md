# 📝 My First Java To-Do List App (Command Line)

This is a small Java project I made to practice what I’ve been learning. It’s a simple to-do list that runs in the terminal. You can add, view, and remove tasks.

I built it using basic Java concepts like classes, loops, and file handling.

## 💡 What It Does

- Add a task
- Show all tasks
- Delete a task
- Save tasks to a file so they don’t disappear when the program closes

---

## 🧪 What I Learned

- How to use `Scanner` for user input
- How to use `ArrayList` to store tasks
- How to write and read from a text file using Java
- How to break a project into smaller files (Task.java, TaskManager.java, etc.)
- Basic if-else and switch statements

---

## 🖥️ How to Run It

1. Make sure you have Java installed
2. Open your terminal
3. Go to the folder with the `.java` files
4. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ````
5. Run the program:

   ```bash
   java Main
   ````

---

## 🗂️ Files

* `Task.java` – holds the task text
* `TaskManager.java` – handles the task list and file saving
* `Main.java` – shows the menu and talks to the user
* `tasks.txt` – where the tasks are saved
